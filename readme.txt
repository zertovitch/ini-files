Welcome to the Ini file manager
===============================

The Ini file manager consists of a package, Config, which
can read and modify informations from various configuration
files known as "ini" files. They are called "ini" files because
they have often the ".ini" extension, but some also have
".inf", ".cfg" extensions. They are actually text files which
look like the following:

     ; Comment line
     
     [Section 1]
     a_string = abcd     # a comment here...
     a_number = +123.456 ; another comment
     
     [Section 2]
     a_string = efgh
